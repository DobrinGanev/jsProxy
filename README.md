ES6 Features - Use cases for Proxy

You can follow along the blog post and look at the exmples one by one, but you can also open `index.html` and browse the examples.

I recommend a recent browser, preferably Chrome.

Some examples require that the code is running on a webserver and not opened from the filesystem. You can use the simple [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm module for that. Just start serving and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
